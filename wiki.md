# Wine Varietals in Washington

Washington State has emerged as one of the premier wine regions in the United States, second only to California in overall production. Thanks to its diverse geography, ranging from the cool, rainy Puget Sound area to the sunny, arid valleys east of the Cascades, the state produces a wide range of high-quality wines. The most prominent varietals include **Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Syrah, Chardonnay, and Riesling**. Each varietal is able to thrive in different conditions across Washingtonâ€™s federally recognized **American Viticultural Areas** (AVAs). Major AVAs like Columbia Valley, Yakima Valley, Walla Walla Valley, and Red Mountain are known for their distinctive soils and microclimates, which give Washington wines their characteristic balance of ripeness, structure, and freshness. Here is a list of the most common Washington state AVA's and their most popular varietal'ss.
